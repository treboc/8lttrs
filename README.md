# WordScramble
This game is a project in the 100daysWithSwiftUI aswell as in the UIKit course by Paul Hudson. My wife started playing it, so I built in some features to make it more replayable.

### What's the goal?
* find as many words as possible
* time is not a thing here, a session could last days or even weeks, take your time

### Features:
* saving and retrying sessions
* share session, either saved ones or the one you're currently playing
* filtering the list of already found words â€“ this makes it easier to check if you've already used the word
* currently English and German localization and basewords
* widgets, so you can keep track of the current session
* light and dark mode support
